# Rotary Encoder
This is my ECE484 midterm project. It includes example code, demos, and information on the rotary encoder. Go to the wiki page for more information. This code section includes all the code used for the demo. The C code uses a regular LCD display to show the position of the rotary encoder. The .ino file is arduino code and it uses an LCD with an I2C module.
